% Use the following line _only_ if you're still using LaTeX 2.09.
%\documentstyle[icml2017,epsf,natbib]{article}
% If you rely on Latex2e packages, like most moden people use this:
\documentclass[10pt]{article}

% use Times
\usepackage{times}
% For figures
\usepackage{graphicx} % more modern
%\usepackage{epsfig} % less modern
\usepackage{subfigure} 

% For citations
\usepackage{natbib}

% For algorithms
\usepackage{algorithm}
\usepackage{algorithmic}

% As of 2011, we use the hyperref package to produce hyperlinks in the
% resulting PDF.  If this breaks your system, please commend out the
% following usepackage line and replace \usepackage{icml2017} with
% \usepackage[nohyperref]{icml2017} above.
\usepackage{hyperref}

% Packages hyperref and algorithmic misbehave sometimes.  We can fix
% this with the following command.
\newcommand{\theHalgorithm}{\arabic{algorithm}}

% Employ the following version of the ``usepackage'' statement for
% submitting the draft version of the paper for review.  This will set
% the note in the first column to ``Under review.  Do not distribute.''
\usepackage{icml2017} 

% Employ this version of the ``usepackage'' statement after the paper has
% been accepted, when creating the final version.  This will set the
% note in the first column to ``Proceedings of the...''
%\usepackage[accepted]{icml2017}

\usepackage{supertabular,booktabs}

	% It is OKAY to include author information, even for blind
	% submissions: the style file will automatically remove it for you
	% unless you've provided the [accepted] option to the icml2017

	% list of affiliations. the first argument should be a (short)
	% identifier you will use later to specify author affiliations
	% Academic affiliations should list Department, University, City, Region, Country
	% Industry affiliations should list Company, City, Region, Country
	
	% you can specify symbols, otherwise they are numbered in order
	% ideally, you should not use this facility. affiliations will be numbered
	% in order of appearance and this is the preferred way.
