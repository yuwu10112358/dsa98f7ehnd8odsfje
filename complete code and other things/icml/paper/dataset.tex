\section{DATASET}
Since our work extends that done by Papernot et al. in \cite{papernot1}, \cite{papernot3}, we utilize the same dataset cited in his papers, which is the MNIST dataset. This ensures the validity of our results. The MNIST hand-written digit dataset of $28 \times 28$ pixel images contains $50,000$ training, $10,000$ validation, and $10,000$ test greyscale images \cite{mnist}. 

%The MNIST dataset is used to replicate the results of transferability between machine learning algorithms in crafting adversarial samples outlined in \cite{papernot3}, ensuring the validity of our approach.

%The MNIST dataset is used to replicate the results of transferability between machine learning algorithms in crafting adversarial samples outlined in \cite{papernot3}. This is done in order to ensure that the experiment performed in this paper is comparable to the work done in \cite{papernot3}. Then image feature reduction was performed to investigate the effect of reduced dimensionality when training the substitute model on the success of adversarial samples in by-passing the oracle.
